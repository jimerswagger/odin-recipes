        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Milanesa De Res, which is basically just a fried beef covered in bread crumbs, is one of my favorite foods.
            My parents spent almost a decade in Argentina and were exposed to this delicious dish.
            The recipe is not hard to do, even if the ingredients are not super authentic, the dish still should taste great.
